Bootage - a parallel initscript launcher
========================================
It's a bit like poor man's upstart ...

Abstract
--------
Bootage is a task execution program providing a small subset of the
functionality found in sysvinit, upstart etc. It collects data about
dependencies between a set of startup script and then executes these scripts
in dependency order. This program was intended to be a faster replacement for
the sysvinit process. With the advent of systemd and other sysvinit
replacements, bootage should be retired in favor of something maintained by
the larger Linux community (see: https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-59).

Description
-------------------
Bootage will parse an optional config file found at /etc/bootage.conf on
startup. Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored. Entries in this
file are in the following format:

script NAME
dep DEPENDENCY...
start RUNLEVELS
stop RUNLEVELS (ignored)
block RUNLEVELS

For example:

script ssh
dep network autofs
start 2 3 4

The directives from the config file have the following meaning:
script: The name of the script.
dep:    Other scripts that must be run before this one.
start:  Run levels at which this script will be run.
stop:   Presumably the run levels where this script will be stopped during
        shutdown but this doesn't seem to be implemented.
block:  The runlevels at which the script will not be run EXCEPT in the case
        where a 'start' stanza explicitly requires it. The purpose of this
        behavior is unknown.

Any scripts found in the rcX.d directory but not mentioned in bootage.conf will
auto-depend on every script with a lower sequence number. Scripts that have a
dep line in the config file will depend only on the scripts explicitly stated.
Dependencies that are not to be started will be ignored.

All scripts will be started as soon as their dependencies have completed
startup. Scripts that are mentioned in bootage.conf but don't exist in rcX.d
will be run if the runlevel matches.

If a script is mentioned in rcX.d and the config file it will be started
regardless of any "start" directive.

Dependencies
------------
Bootage links against librt. At runtime it needs startup scripts to do anything
meaningful.
